# Chrome Extension to Track Sales Leads

Using Vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS and the chrome.extension API, I built an extension that enables sales reps to track the profile URL's of sales leads.

There are four button with different functionalities:

1. Save Input - Saves text boxt value only if it's a valid link
2. Save Tab - Saves current broswer tab
3. Export CSV - Exports all leads into a CSV
4. Delete All - Delets all leads saved in local storage

This was really fun and my first project ever in client side JS.
